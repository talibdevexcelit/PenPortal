/**
 * API Entry Point for Vercel Serverless Deployment
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * ‚ö†Ô∏è This `/api/index.js` file acts as the entry point for serverless functions
 * on Vercel. It is designed to initialize the Express app and handle incoming requests.
 *
 * üëâ Define all routes and middleware in `app.js` to keep this file clean and modular.
 *
 * This structure is optimized for **production-ready** serverless environments.
 * Modify with care, especially when adjusting the export or request handling.
